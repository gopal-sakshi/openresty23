Nginx is often used as
- load balancer
- a reverse proxy
- an HTTP Cache

Forward Proxy servers
- entities that act as middlemen between a client and the host of the requested resource. 
- This means the traffic goes through an additional machine in order to get to the destination (host server). 
- The proxy continues the request on behalf of the client
    so when the host server accepts the request, they only see the IP of the proxy. 
- In comparison, a reverse proxy sits directly in front of the web
    and routes the request coming from the client to the correct web server (inside a network of multiple servers).
