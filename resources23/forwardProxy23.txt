4 components

Client                      testing_backend/../forward-proxy23.js
forward proxy               openresty23/../z_forward23.conf server listening on 14590 port
Internet            
Resource server             our simpleExpress webserver

============================================================

forward proxy sits infront of clients
from client - it accepts request and forwads it to backend web server
receives the response from webserver & sends it back to client

control_flow

    testing_backend
    openresty23
    proxy_pass to simpleExpress
    response sent back to openresty23
    openresty23 sends the same response back to testing_backend

MEANING: 
    simpleExpress web server never knows where the request comes from
    the request can come from testing_backend (or) testingV16 (or) anywhere
    all simpleExpress knows is openresty23 as the origin

Forward proxy is something the client sets up in order to connect to rest of the internet
============================================================

Why forward proxy
- Masking the IP & location to gain access to location-restricted services
- For isolated internal networks that need to connect to specific resources on the internet
- For caching requests to specific servers for content that rarely changes in order to save resources

proxies do not encrypt traffic, 
whereas VPNs redirect the traffic through secure & encrypted tunnels.
