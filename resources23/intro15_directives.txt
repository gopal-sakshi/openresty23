nginx configuration block
- it is a very bad example of using "configuration as code"

    location ~ ^/mobile/(web/app.htm) {
        set $type $1;
        set $orig_args $args;
        if ( $http_user_Agent ~ "(iPhone|iPad|Android)" ) {
            rewrite  ^/mobile/(.*) http://touch.foo.com/mobile/$1 last;
        }
        proxy_pass http://foo.com/$type?$orig_args;
    }

- master worker mode
- OpenResty adds unique privileged agent to nginx master-worker model
- nginx has 11 execution phases 
    {
        NGX_HTTP_POST_READ_PHASE = 0
        server rewrite
        find config
        ...........
        .......
        NGX_HTTP_LOG_PHASE
    }
- llly OpenResty has 11 directives ( *_by_lua ) related to NGINX phase

    initialization phase        init_by_lua, init_worker_by_lua
    rewrite/access phase        ssl_certificate, set, rewrite, access 
    content phase               balancer, content, header_filter, body_filter
    log phase                   log_by_lua

=========================================================================

init_by_lua
- only when the master process is created
- preload all Lua modules

init_by_worker_lua
- only when each worker process is created

others
- triggered by client requests


set_by_lua:         setting variables.
rewrite_by_lua:     forwarding, redirection, etc.
access_by_lua:      access, permissions, etc.
content_by_lua:     generating return content.
header_filter_by_lua:   response header filtering processing.
body_filter_by_lua:     response body filtering processing.
log_by_lua:             logging.


convert Plain text API ----> encryption/decryption

location /mixed {
    access_by_lua '...';                // add decrypt logic here
    content_by_lua '...';               // untouched
    body_filter_by_lua '...';           // add encrypt logic here
}
